<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate learner diving into full stack development with the goal of becoming a well-rounded developer. 
  I'm eager to understand every layer of technology, which is why I'm exploring both front-end and back-end development while also 
  planning to build innovative apps using Swift. With a myriad of app ideas waiting to be realized, my coding journey is fueled 
  by creativity and a drive to bring these visions to life. Vietnam holds a special place in my heartâ€”not only is it where my 
  family is from, but it's also a source of inspiration and a feeling of home that motivates my work. This blend of technical 
  ambition and personal heritage shapes my pursuit of knowledge and innovation every day.</p>
